# Nestlé India – Plant Engineering Internship

**Duration:** 19 May 2025 – 28 June 2025  
**Organization:** Nestlé India, Pantnagar  
**Role:** Chemical Engineering Intern  
**Project Titles:**  
1. Plant-Wide P&ID Update for Gasket Management  
2. Rotary Valve Maintenance and Safety Review  

---

## 📘 Overview
This internship focused on two major plant-level engineering initiatives — improving gasket documentation across process units and enhancing safety protocols for rotary valves. The project provided hands-on exposure to real industrial systems, P&ID analysis, preventive maintenance planning, and safety engineering.

---

## 🏭 Key Technical Contributions
- **Gasket Management:**  
  - Conducted plant-wide walkdowns to map gasket materials and specifications.  
  - Updated and validated Piping & Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs) for over 4500 gasket entries.  
  - Improved traceability and maintenance documentation, minimizing leak risks and downtime.

- **Rotary Valve Maintenance & Safety:**  
  - Audited rotary (star) valves across multiple production lines.  
  - Identified missing tamper-proof mechanisms and proposed a new bolt design using AutoCAD.  
  - Drafted a new Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for valve maintenance and Lockout–Tagout (LOTO) practices.

## ⚙️ Skills Developed
- P&ID interpretation and redlining  
- AutoCAD drafting and mechanical design communication  
- Rotary valve inspection and maintenance techniques  
- Process safety, preventive maintenance, and SOP development  
- Cross-functional collaboration and engineering documentation
