# Modular Remote-Operated Turret (Academic Prototype)

**Duration:** 20 May 2025 – 20 June 2025  
**Organization:** Machfly Aerospace Technologies Pvt. Ltd.  
**Role:** Engineering Intern (Design and CAD)  
**Project Title:** Design and Development of CAD Model for a Modular Remote-Operated Turret  

---

## 📘 Overview
This project involved the conceptual and CAD design of a modular, remotely operated turret system intended as an academic prototype for exploring electromechanical system integration, sensor placement, and remote actuation mechanisms. The internship emphasized multidisciplinary learning at the intersection of mechanical design, automation, and systems engineering.

---

## 🏗️ Technical Work
- Developed a **3D CAD model** integrating actuation, mounting, and sensor components using **OnShape**.  
- Performed **weight balance analysis** and **center-of-gravity optimization** for mechanical stability.  
- Designed the **enclosure** using lightweight alloys for robustness and modularity.  
- Studied integration of electro-optical subsystems and drive motors for pan-tilt control.  
- Documented design parameters and mechanical specifications for future prototyping.
